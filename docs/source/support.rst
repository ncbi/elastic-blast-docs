Please email help requests or bug reports to elastic-blast-support@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
Before submitting a bug report, please ensure you are using ElasticBLAST version {VERSION}.
If not, please kindly upgrade your installation, as the issue you are running
into may have been already addressed.

Please also see the troubleshooting pages:

* :ref:`PyPI installation troubleshooting <missing_wheel>`
* :ref:`troubleshooting`

Please help the development team help you: 

* When reporting problems, please provide us with:

   * Your configuration file and command line invocation
   * The ElasticBLAST logfile (``elastic-blast.log`` by default)
   * The output of ``elastic-blast status --verbose --cfg YOUR_CONFIG_FILE``
   * Your system's information and ElasticBLAST working files, i.e. the output
     of the commands below and the ``elastic-blast-diagnostics.tgz`` file. It
     is OK if any of these commands fail ;)

.. code-block:: bash

    uname -a
    python3 -m sysconfig
    env

    # For GCP only
    gcloud info
    gsutil ls -lr ${YOUR_RESULTS_BUCKET}
    gsutil -qm cp -r ${YOUR_RESULTS_BUCKET}/logs .
    gsutil -qm cp -r ${YOUR_RESULTS_BUCKET}/metadata .
    tar czf elastic-blast-diagnostics.tgz logs metadata

    # For AWS only
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    aws configure list
    aws s3 ls --recursive ${YOUR_RESULTS_BUCKET}
    aws s3 cp --recursive ${YOUR_RESULTS_BUCKET}/logs logs
    aws s3 cp --recursive ${YOUR_RESULTS_BUCKET}/metadata metadata
    aws-get-auto-scaling-events.sh > logs/auto-scaling-events.log
    awslimitchecker -l > logs/aws-quota.log
    awslimitchecker -u > logs/aws-usage.log
    aws batch describe-jobs --jobs `awk -F, '{print $1}' metadata/job-ids-v2.json | awk -F: '{print $2}'` --output json > logs/aws-batch-qs-jobs.log
    aws batch describe-jobs --jobs `awk -F, '{print $2}' metadata/job-ids-v2.json | awk -F: '{print $2}'` --output json > logs/aws-batch-js-jobs.log
    aws batch describe-compute-environments --output json > logs/aws-batch-ce.log
    tar czf elastic-blast-diagnostics.tgz logs metadata


* If the :ref:`janitor` is not enabled, **always run elastic-blast delete after/before every ElasticBLAST search**.
* Consider using the unix ``screen`` (`wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_(Unix)>`_, `man page <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/script.1.html>`_) tool to capture the
  output of your usage of ElasticBLAST and attaching the session log to your
  problem report. 

Thanks! :)
