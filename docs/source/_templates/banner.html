            <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The current GCP implementation may fail to
            properly release cloud resources, which could lead to excess user
            charges. We are actively working on a fix and expect to release it
            soon. <br><p>
            In the interim, we recommend using our AWS implementation. If you
            prefer to continue using GCP, a workaround is available to resolve
            the issue - please update the required kubernetes version as
            outlined on <a href="gcp-issues.html">the known issues page</a>.
            <br><P>
