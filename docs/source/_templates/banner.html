        <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The current GCP implementation may fail to properly release cloud resources, which could lead to excess user charges. We expect to release a fix soon. In the interim, we suggest using our AWS implementation, or for those who wish to use GCP, we have provided a workaround that, when applied, addresses this issue. For more information, please see <a href="gcp-issues.html">the known issues page</a>. (Message date: March 04, 2025)
