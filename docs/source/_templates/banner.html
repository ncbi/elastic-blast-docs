            <b>IMPORTANT:</b> ElasticBLAST version prior to 1.4.0 may fail to
            properly release cloud resources, which could lead to excess user
            charges. We recommend upgrading ElasticBLAST to its latest version.
            <br><p>
            As a temporary workaround, we recommend using our AWS implementation or
            updating the required kubernetes version as outlined on <a href="gcp-issues.html">the known issues page</a>.
