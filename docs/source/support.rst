Support
=======

You can email help requests to elastic-blast-support@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

Please help the development team help you: 

* When reporting problems, please provide us with:

   * Your configuration file
   * The ElasticBLAST logfile (``elastic-blast.log`` by default)
   * Your system's information, i.e. the output of the commands below:

.. code-block:: bash

    # It' is OK if any of these commands fail ;)
    uname -a
    python3 -m sysconfig
    env
    # For GCP only
    gcloud info
    # For AWS only
    aws sts get-caller-identity
    aws configure list
    aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name $(awk '/name.:/ {print $NF}' elastic-blast.log | tr -d ",'" | tail -1) --region $(awk '/region.:/ {print $NF}' elastic-blast.log | tr -d ",}'" | tail -1) --output json


* If the :ref:`janitor` is not enabled, **always run elastic-blast delete after/before every ElasticBLAST search**.
* Consider using the unix ``screen`` (`wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_(Unix)>`_, `man page <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/script.1.html>`_) tool to capture the
  output of your usage of ElasticBLAST and attaching the session log to your
  problem report. 

Thanks! :)
