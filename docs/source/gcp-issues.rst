===================

.. _file_leak:

Files left in cloud storage
---------------------------

ElasticBLAST uses cloud storage to temporarily store query sequences and
internal logs and metadata so that they are easily accessible during its
operation. Sometimes deleting these files after the search is not successful.
To double check and delete them, please run the commands below. 
``ELB_RESULTS`` below represents the location where your results are stored.

.. code-block:: bash

   gsutil ls gs://${ELB_RESULTS}/query_batches  # to list query files
   gsutil -m rm gs://${ELB_RESULTS}/query_batches/*  # to delete query files

   gsutil ls gs://${ELB_RESULTS}/logs  # to list log files
   gsutil -m rm gs://${ELB_RESULTS}/logs/*  # to delete log files

   gsutil ls gs://${ELB_RESULTS}/metadata  # list metadata files
   gsutil -m rm gs://${ELB_RESULTS}/logs/*  # to delete metadata files

.. _elb_batch_len_setting:

Batch length setting
--------------------

The value of :ref:`ELB_BATCH_LEN` greatly affects performance. The defaults are reasonable, but may not be optimal in some cases. We are in the process of determining better values for various programs and use cases.


.. _too_many_jobs:

Too many query batches leads to failed execution
------------------------------------------------

ElasticBLAST divides query sequences into batches and searches them in parallel. The :ref:`ELB_BATCH_LEN` parameter controls the size of a single batch. If the ElasticBLAST configuration leads to more than 5,000 query batches, ElasticBLAST will exit with an error message prompting you to increase :ref:`ELB_BATCH_LEN` parameter to decrease the number of query batches.
